**[Vircadia World](/#features) lets you build better games, faster, with teams of any size, from indie to AAAA.**

Unlike rigid client-server solutions, Vircadia World uses **PostgreSQL** (with Bun.sh), so you define and synchronize your game's world in standard SQL. This gives you full control over your game's data model, making it easy to scale from small prototypes to massive multiplayer worlds with the same system.

* Define and alter world state with SQL
* Use [SDKs](/vircadia-world/sdk/vircadia-world-sdk-ts) to build your game faster (more coming soon)
* Deploy and scale natively in Docker
* All managed by a Bun.sh powered [CLI](/vircadia-world/cli) and [services](/vircadia-world/server/service/api/)
* Security validated for production use by [enterprise partners](/#sponsors)

[Get started](/vircadia-world) building!
