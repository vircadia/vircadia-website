[Vircadia World](/#features) is a reactivity layer that helps you build higher quality games, faster, and with smaller teams.

Most game server solutions force your game to fit a rigid client-server model. The only alternative, building a custom server, is often unnecessary and time-consuming.

Vircadia World takes a different approach: it uses **PostgreSQL** (with Bun.sh) at its core, allowing you to define and alter your world state in standard SQL. This means you can tailor the schema to your game's needs and scale from small arenas to massive multiplayer worlds.

* Define and alter world state with SQL (PostgreSQL)
* Deploy and scale natively in Docker
* All managed by a Bun.sh powered CLI and services 
* Security validated for production use by [enterprise partners](#sponsors)
